                    <br /> Welcome to the Membrane Technology and Applications Lab, a leading research facility dedicated to advancing membrane science and engineering in Vietnam. We develop innovative materials and systems for water and wastewater treatment, food preservation, and beyond.
                    <br /> Our multidisciplinary team focuses on creating membranes with superior performance, antifouling properties, and chlorine resistance. We also utilize agricultural by-products to fabricate biodegradable packaging films and aim to produce antibacterial materials for wastewater and gas treatment.
                    <br /> We explore membrane and film technologies to address global challenges like clean water access and environmental protection, translating our research into practical, sustainable solutions.
                    <br /> Join us in pushing the boundaries of membrane technology for a better future.
